    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This spaghetti carbonara is a super rich "bacon and egg" pasta dish that's great to serve for company. This recipe also makes an unusual brunch offering.</p>
    <p>It's a classic Italian pasta made with simple ingredients, creating a creamy sauce without using cream, relying on eggs and cheese for its texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine (optional)</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the water.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until crispy, about 8 minutes. Remove bacon from the skillet and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Add remaining olive oil to the skillet. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in white wine and cook until alcohol evaporates, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese together in a bowl until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding reserved pasta water if it seems dry.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat. Add beaten egg mixture and toss constantly with tongs until eggs are barely set. Quickly add remaining Parmesan cheese and toss again.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
