    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This authentic tiramisu recipe includes all the key components of the favorite Italian dessert: ladyfingers soaked in espresso, mascarpone, and cocoa.</p>
    <p>It's a no-bake dessert that's rich, creamy, and perfect for special occasions, originating from Italy with a balance of coffee bitterness and sweet creaminess.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup strong brewed coffee or espresso</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brandy or rum (optional)</li>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>6 large egg whites</li>
        <li>24 ladyfingers</li>
        <li>Unsalted cocoa powder for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine coffee and brandy in a shallow bowl; set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl until pale and thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently fold mascarpone cheese into the egg yolk mixture until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into the mascarpone mixture.</li>
